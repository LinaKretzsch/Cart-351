##SketchInParts

SketchInParts is a collaborative drawing game which can be played 
by 3 different users. This project was created in the framework of 
a Web class CART 351 I took during my 2019 Fall semester at Concordia University. 
Upon loading the application, a user is randomly assigned to draw either 
the top, mid or bottom part of a drawing. After choosing to submit the 
sketch, all 3 parts are combined to a finished piece which can be 
admired in the website's gallery. While developing SketchInParts, 
I pushed my own boundaries and learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and Node.Js in order to construct the entire project. The application 
is currently not finished and I am re-designing and attempting to 
create a finished version of SketchInParts. The re-designed version is still 
in process in the repository CART-457.
